## AutoCount comparison baseline (reviewed 22 August 2026)

AutoCount does not publish one honest, edition-independent “total feature count.” Its official Accounting pages state that there are up to 15 document-entry types and more than 1,000 report combinations, while editions, POS and add-ons provide different sets. Treating those report combinations as 1,000 separate software functions would be misleading.

For a reproducible comparison, this project counts the 72 individual entries in AutoCount's official POS “Features Summary” once each. Against that fixed POS list, the current Kōn-Kōn web application has:

- 38 fully covered entries
- 4 partially covered entries
- 30 not yet covered entries
- 42 of 72 entries with at least partial coverage (58.3%)

Breakdown by the official POS headings:

- Receipt printing: 5 full, 1 partial, 1 missing
- Transactions: 3 full, 0 partial, 7 missing
- Data entry: 3 full, 2 partial, 6 missing
- Multiple payment methods: 1 full, 0 partial, 0 missing
- Routine operation: 2 full, 0 partial, 3 missing
- Back-end maintenance: 11 full, 1 partial, 3 missing
- POS reports: 9 full, 0 partial, 5 missing
- Stock reports: 4 full, 0 partial, 5 missing

“Partial” is used when the safe web workflow covers only part of the named desktop feature—for example quantity changes without per-line price override, or scanner-pass terminal control without full multi-outlet terminal maintenance. The comparison source is AutoCount's [official POS feature summary](https://member.autocountsoft.com/products/ac_pos/helpfile/pos_introduction.htm). The wider roadmap is also checked against the [official AutoCount Cloud Accounting feature and plan page](https://www.autocountsoft.com/pro-cloud-acc.html) and the [official Accounting feature pages](https://member.autocountsoft.com/products/ac_accounting/info/features1.aspx).

This count is a delivery benchmark, not a claim of AutoCount parity. Accounting, country compliance and optional plug-ins are tracked below and must pass their own acceptance tests before being counted as shipped.

## Next accounting modules

- Year-end adjustment workflow, retained-earnings transfer and accountant close pack

## Country packs

Delivered preparation tools: the country report desk exports financial statements and reviewed working figures for all 249 selectable countries, with SG/MY/AU/GB working-paper layouts and saved presentation designs. Invoices, receipts and supplier bills generate encrypted, immutable general UBL XML / accounting JSON and MyInvois 1.0 document structures for types 01–04 and 11–14. Malaysia alone has an official sandbox/production submission and validation-status connector; authority acceptance is shown only from MyInvois responses. No other national filing network, signed v1.1 document or completed statutory return is claimed. Details: [country documents](country-documents.md).

A filing-ready country pack must include versioned tax codes/rates, chart templates, fiscal-calendar rules, rounding, statutory report layouts, e-invoice schemas, export validation and official-source metadata. It must also include regression fixtures and a qualified local-accountant sign-off date.

Until that lifecycle exists, the UI must call outputs “management reports,” never “certified tax returns.” Singapore is the first planned pack; other countries must be installed as separately versioned packages rather than hard-coded conditionals.

## Independent features planned

- Brew recipe costing and margin simulation
- Member taste profile and consent-controlled recommendations
